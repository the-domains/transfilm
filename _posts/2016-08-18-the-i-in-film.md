Who are you? Who do you aspire to be?

The art of film is not that different from the art of becoming. The "I" you know derives from a process of synthesis and adaptation between your inner world and the exterior reality, something that has been taking place since you were born.

If "I" is in truth an internalised image, composed of our experiences of encounter with the world, isn't that a process of framing reality? Well, framing reality is pretty much what a filmmaker does. Same situation, different person, different framing, different story.

> Becoming a director takes hard work, research, and faithful commitment to your dreams and inspirations (Bartesaghi, 2016, p. xii)

There, your film as potentially a mirror of yourself. Furthermore, can the experience of making film extrapolate what is and take you on a journey of becoming?

What is your story? What is your form? What is your reality?
